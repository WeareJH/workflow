## Initial Setup

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) installed, plus the [Workflow tool](https://github.com/WeareJH/workflow) tool and its prerequisites.

If you want to supply a database seed, put the SQL file in `.docker/db` before starting.

```sh
$ git clone {repository} {workdir} && cd {workdir}
$ cp .docker/local.env.dist .docker/local.env
$ workflow start
```

Your recommended to run two terminal windows as the start command will start a file watcher copying in files to the container on change which you should keep running.

In a new terminal you can now finish off your setup dependant on your installation type.

### Supplied Database Seed

If you supplied a database seed you simply need to run the configure command.

```sh
$ workflow mc
```

### Fresh Magento Database

If you want a fresh database and haven't supplied a database seed you need to run a full install.

```sh
$ workflow mfi
```

After the initial setup you will be able to use the `workflow` too to start, stop development as and when you wish, dynamic data will stay persistant until you remove it through docker.

*Note: You can configure the `.docker/local.env` file to meet your requirements but likely not required*
